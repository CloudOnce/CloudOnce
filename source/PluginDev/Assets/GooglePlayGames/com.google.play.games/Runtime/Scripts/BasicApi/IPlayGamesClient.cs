    /// <remarks>Concrete implementations
    /// might be, for example, the client for Android or for iOS. One fundamental concept
    /// that implementors of this class must adhere to is stable authentication state.
    /// This means that once Authenticate() returns true through its callback, the user is
    /// considered to be forever after authenticated while the app is running. The implementation
    /// must make sure that this is the case -- for example, it must try to silently
    /// re-authenticate the user if authentication is lost or wait for the authentication
    /// process to get fixed if it is temporarily in a bad state (such as when the
    /// Activity in Android has just been brought to the foreground and the connection to
    /// the Games services hasn't yet been established). To the user of this
    /// interface, once the user is authenticated, they're forever authenticated.
    /// Unless, of course, there is an unusual permanent failure such as the underlying
    /// service dying, in which it's acceptable that API method calls will fail.
    ///
    /// <para>All methods can be called from the game thread. The user of this interface
    /// DOES NOT NEED to call them from the UI thread of the game. Transferring to the UI
    /// thread when necessary is a responsibility of the implementors of this interface.</para>
